<title> Madison Mackin - BIO </title>
</head>
<body>
My major is information management and technology and I am studying web design!
Some of my hobbies are playing tennis, going to the beach, cooking and spending time with my family. 
I live in boca raton, florida so with the florida heat in the summer I love being in the Syracuse cold - getting the best of both worlds.
